# Investigating the Netflix Repository: Research on Movies Released in the 1990s
Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since grown into one of the biggest entertainment and media companies in the world.

With so many movies and series available on the platform, this is the perfect opportunity to flex my exploratory data analysis skills and dive into the entertainment industry.

I work for a production company that specializes(hope to) in nostalgic styles, and I want to research movies released in the 1990s. By exploring Netflix data, I aim to gain insights into this incredible decade of filmmaking.

I have been provided with the dataset netflix_data.csv, along with a table detailing the column names and descriptions. My goal is to perform exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and key details about 90s movies.

Letâ€™s dive in!
